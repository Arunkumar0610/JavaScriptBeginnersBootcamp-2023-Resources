  <h1>DOM- Document Object Model</h1> 
  <p> <span style="color:blue;">step-1:</span>
    run <span  style="color:blue;" >document</span> in browser console you will get same your html source code in console.
</p>
  <ol>
      <li>There are two instances in which the browser generated DOM will be different than the HTML source code.</li>
      <li>The DOM is modified by client side javascript.</li>
      <li>The browser automatically fixes errors and the source code.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Lets demontrate how the DOM can be modifies by client side javascript</p>
  <p> <span style="color:blue;">step-2:</span>
    run <span  style="color:blue;" >document.body</span> in browser console you will get same your body tag code from html document which is nested with all the tags present in body tag in console.
</p>

<p><b>so here document is an object and body is a property of that object we have accessed with dot notation</b></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">step-3:</span><b>We can change the body element from our console lets change the background color of body to tomato
    by running <span  style="color:blue;" >document.body.style.backgroundColor="tomato"</span> in browser console and see the changes.
    And you can notice that element color of body in DOM is changed in Elements tab.
    But if you see the view page source by right click and select view page source you can see that
    there is no style added to body tag so that the source of the website will not be changed and will
    never be affected by client side javascript.
</b></p>

<h2> Now lets work on DOM</h2>
<p><span style="color:blue;">step-4:</span> Now we added a (anchor tag) in our source code which we navigate to index.html (same page we are in)
    if i wanted to get this anchor tag in the console i added a id name navigation to this tag by using id i will
get this anchor tag in browser console. Now run this in console <span  style="color:blue;" >document.getElementById('navigation');</span>  so we get 
the anchor tag in the console with all the content inside it</p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">step-4:</span> lets assign this element <span  style="color:blue;" >document.getElementById('navigation');</span> to variable navigationLink in console so we can access it and can modify its properties</p>
<ul>
    <li> run this in console <span style="color:blue;">var navigationLink=document.getElementById('navigation');</span> -
    we assigned the dom element anchor tag in to variable we can access it and modify now using this variable
    </li>
    <li >run this in console <span style="color:blue;">navigationLink;</span> will get the anchor tag content</li>
    <li>let's modify href attribute of anchor tag using this in console <span style="color:blue;">navigationLink.href="https://www.npr.org;</span>. Now the href attribute is changed to npr site</li>
    <li >let's modify text  of anchor tag using this in console<span style="color:blue;">navigationLink.textContent=Vist NPR;</span> . Now Home is changed to Visit NPR</li>
</ul>

<h2>DOM & Nodes</h2>
<p> There are so many nodes but we mainly use three nodes they are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Element Nodes - When an HTML element is an item in the DOM. It is referred to as an Element Node</li>
    <li>Text Nodes - Any alone text outside of an element is known as text node</li>
    <li>Comment Nodes- an HTML comment is an comment node </li>
</ul>
<b> In addition to these nodes the document itself is an document node. Which is the root of all other nodes</b>
<p> DOM Tree: The document consists of a tree structure of nested nodes, which is often referred to as the DOM tree. </p>
<p> Like in the Family tree the nodes in the dom are also referred to as parents, children And
    siblings, depending on their relation to other nodes.
