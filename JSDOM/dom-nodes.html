    <h1>this is an element node</h1>
    <!--this is an comment node-->
    this is an text node

    <p>Now inspect and click on the h1 tag in elements tab and you see ==$0 at the end so by using that $0 we can get node type</p>
    <p> Lets try- <span style="color: blue;">$0.NodeType;</span> o/p -> 1</p>
    <p>Now inspect and click on the comment in elements tab and you see ==$0 at the end so by using that $0 we can get node type</p>
    <p> Lets try- <span style="color: blue;">$0.NodeType;</span> o/p -> 8</p>
    <p>Now inspect and click on the text node in elements tab and you see ==$0 at the end so by using that $0 we can get node type</p>
    <p> Lets try- <span style="color: blue;">$0.NodeType;</span> o/p -> 3</p>

    <p> You can get the nodeType by using document object also like <span style="color: blue;">document.body.nodeType;</span> o/p->1</p>
    <p> Here in this document html is root has 2 children -> head and body.this are sibilings to each other.head and body has childrens too. so basically it is a DOM tree</p>
    <b>
        so then the nodeType of <br/> elementnode is 1 <br/> commentnode is 8 <br/> textnode is 3
    </b>
